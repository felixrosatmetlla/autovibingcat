# autovibingcat

Autovibing cat is a simple program that given a title of a song an artist name, takes the first video it finds on youtube, and creates a vibing cate meme adapting the cat speed to an approximation of the song's passage bpm.

The program takes 2 input variables:

  - start(optional): the second of the song where you want the cat video to start. The default value is 60.
